# Baby Bloom Mobile

This folder holds the React Native based mobile application for Baby Bloom. To get started with developing this mobile application, follow the *How to get started* steps below.

## How to get started

A  few prerequisites are needed to get started with the application.

1. First and foremost, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. After node is installed, [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/)
3. For testing the application on your mobile, install [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your phone.

While Node and/or Expo CLI are being installed, you may clone the repository. After installing the prerequisites, hop into the mobile folder of the cloned repository. Once inside the mobile folder, run:

``` npm install ```

Once installation is done, run:

``` expo start ```

This command will start a expo development server, from which you can test the application. Once booted it will load up your standard webbrowser with a expo development server page. On this page you can scan the generated QR-code with the  [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) application. This app will download the Javascript bundle that has been created with expo start.
